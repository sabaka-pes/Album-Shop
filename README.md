This project is a sales tracker, it can be used to track the status of any products, in this example it is used for a music store.
This project demonstrates test writing skills.
There are `createAlbum`, `triggerPayment`, `triggerDelivery` functions. You can create a new album and deliver an order only if you are an owner of this contarct. `AlbumTracker` is using OppenZeppelin library for access control. 
There is a test file `AlbumTracker.test.ts`.
